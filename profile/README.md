## 🔎 What is Radio Silence for Mac?

**Radio Silence** is a minimal and powerful firewall for macOS, designed for users who want complete control over their apps' outgoing network connections — without bloated interfaces or complex configurations.

This lightweight tool lets you **block any application from connecting to the internet**, keeping your personal data safe and reducing unwanted network activity. It’s perfect for privacy-conscious users, developers, or anyone who wants to make sure certain apps stay offline.

Unlike traditional firewalls, **Radio Silence runs silently in the background**, consuming virtually zero system resources. You won’t see pop-ups, notifications, or need to approve every connection manually. Just choose the app you want to block, and Radio Silence does the rest.

With full compatibility for **macOS Monterey, Ventura, and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)**, it's the go-to firewall tool for modern Mac users who want simplicity and security.
